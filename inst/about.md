Cognitive processes have been shown to predict the onset, maintenance,
and relapse of various mental health disorders. Such processes, although
seemingly beneficial for survival, can sometimes become maladaptive.

For example, people suffering from Alcohol Use Disorder often show
increased attentional bias towards alcohol cues. In other words, these
individuals are more likely to be distracted by pictures of alcohol
compared to healthy people. Similarly, individuals suffering from
symptoms of depression or anxiety are often more distracted by negative
images or videos (e.g., traumatic and sad scenes).

In this Project Explicit, we hope to further explore these underlying
processes and their relationships to mental health and bring the users
of our app closer to a better understanding of their own mental and
cognitive health. This project was partially inspired by Harvard
University’s Project Implicit (see
<https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/education.html> to learn more).

You can start by choosing one (or more) of the cognitive tasks, and one
(or more) mental health questionnaires from the Menu bar. Each specific
task and questionnaire are explained in more detail on their respective
page. Once you have completed your chosen tasks and surveys, you can go
to Your Results page to see your feedback and interact with the plot to
play around some “what-if” scenarios.
