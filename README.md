# ProjectExplicit
An app/site that includes cognitive tasks and mental health questionnaires with feedback. Inspired by the Project Implicit 

The Project Explicit will include several different tasks measuring cognitive control (e.g., attentional control, working memory capacity, etc) and several short questionnaires measuring internalizing and externalizing symptoms (e.g., anxiety, alcohol use, etc.). After completing a task and/or questionnaire, users will receive feedback on their performance, symptom measures and the relation of the two with each other. 

For the purpose of this class, this will only be a short demo, and it will only include 1-2 tasks (e.g., Digit Span Task or Stroop task), and 1-2 questionnaires. If feasible (within this class project) the feedback will also use comparisons on how each participant's score compares to other users that have completed the tasks (i.e., percentiles).
