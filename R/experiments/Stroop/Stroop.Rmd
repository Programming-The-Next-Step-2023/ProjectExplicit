This example is the default jspsych template that gets loaded by the jspsychr package. It involves a simple Stroop experiment, with stimulus creation handled by R.

The index.html file runs the experiment, the index.rmd file compiles the html experiment. 

The run.R file will run compile and run the experiment in a local browser, with data saved to the data folder.
