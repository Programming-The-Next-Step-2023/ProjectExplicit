# Package Description
The `ProjectExplicit` package is a ShinyApp containing several different cognitive tasks and mental health questionnaires. The users of the app first choose which cognitive task they want to complete, and which mental health symptom questionnaire they want to fill out.

After completing the task and the questionnaire, the users receive personalized feedback on how well they did in the task, and where they stand on the scale of mental health symptom severity. They can also interact with the plots to see where they stand compared to others (i.e., the general population), and how the cognitive tasks relate to mental health symptoms.

# ProjectExplicit App Demo for Users
Let's have a quick look at different pages of the app!
